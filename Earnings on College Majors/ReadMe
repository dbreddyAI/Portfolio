Data Visualization Project: Visualize earnings based on College Majors
In this project, I analyzed data on recent graduates of 172 college majors got from the FiveThirtyEight's data repositry
[https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors]
This data contains the information about the graduates employment stastistics,earnings,Enrollment population and other aspects of 
various majors.All data is from American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series.
Using the data, I analyzed various relations between the data items through some exploratory visualization and analysis. 
I created various charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn visualization libraries.
This analysis can be useful in knowing the different correlations between the variables and distribution of earnings,gender differences based
on college majors.
This can also be helpful in deciding the impact of attributes on popularity and enrollment of majors which can help in predicting the value
of each college major.For now, I have explored the relation between variables in the process of showcasing data visualization skills in
python. The script and the charts can be found in the `College-Majors.ipynb` notebook.
